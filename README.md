## üê≥ Why Docker?

Containers enable this app to:

- Run identically across any environment (dev, staging, production)
- Isolate dependencies for each service
- Use **internal Docker networking** (`http://backend:5050`) for secure service discovery
- Scale effortlessly (scale backend or database independently)
- Enable fast CI/CD pipeline setups in future
